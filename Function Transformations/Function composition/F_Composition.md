## Solution Breakdown

1. The function `compose` takes a single parameter `functions`, which is an array containing the functions that need to be composed.

2. The first condition checks if the input array `functions` is empty. If it is, it means there are no functions to compose, and the code returns an "identity function." An identity function is a function that takes an argument and returns the same value without any modification.

3. If the `functions` array is not empty, the code proceeds to the next step.

4. The `reduceRight` method is used on the `functions` array. The `reduceRight` method iterates over the array from right to left (in reverse order) and reduces it to a single value. In this case, the value being reduced is a composed function.

5. Inside the `reduceRight` method, for each iteration, the `prev` parameter represents the previously composed function, and the `curr` parameter represents the current function from the array.

6. A new function is returned that represents the composition of `curr` and `prev`. This new function takes an argument `x`, applies `prev` to `x`, and then applies `curr` to the result of `prev(x)`. Essentially, this is how the functions are composed, and the sequence of application is from right to left, contrary to the order of the original array.

7. After the `reduceRight` method has finished iterating over all the functions in the `functions` array, the result is a single composed function that represents the entire composition of all the functions in the array.

8. Finally, the composed function is returned from the `compose` function.

## Function Composition

Function composition is a powerful concept in functional programming as it allows you to create complex behavior by combining simple, reusable functions. It encourages the separation of concerns and modularity, making the code more maintainable and easier to reason about. By composing functions, you can chain operations together, applying transformations step by step, and creating more expressive and elegant code. The `compose` function provided here is just one way to achieve function composition in JavaScript, but there are other methods and libraries(eg.`Ramda` and `Lodash` ) that facilitate this concept as well.
