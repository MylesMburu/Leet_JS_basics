## Solution Explaination
The code defines a `reduce` function that takes an array (`nums`), a callback function (`fn`), and an initial value (`init`) as arguments. The purpose of this function is to reduce the array into a single value by iteratively applying the callback function to each element.

1. Conditional Statement (if):
   - The `if` statement checks if the length of the `nums` array is equal to 0 (`nums.length === 0`).
   - If the array is empty, it means there are no elements to reduce, so the `init` value is directly returned as the result.

2. Initial Value:
   - The `init` value represents the initial accumulator value or starting point for the reduction process.
   - It is passed as an argument to the `reduce` function and is assigned to the `reducedValue` variable.

3. Array Iteration (for...of loop):
   - The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over each element of the `nums` array.
   - On each iteration, the current element of the array is assigned to the `i` variable.

4. Reducing the Array:
   - The `fn` callback function is invoked with the current accumulator value (`reducedValue`) and the current element of the array (`i`): `fn(reducedValue, i)`.
   - The return value of the callback function is assigned back to `reducedValue`, effectively updating the accumulator for the next iteration.
   - This process continues for each element in the `nums` array until all elements have been processed.

5. Returning the Reduced Value:
   - Once the iteration is complete, the final reduced value is returned by the `reduce` function.

## Array Reduction
Array reduction, as performed by the `reduce` function, is a common operation in JavaScript. It allows you to derive a single value from an array by applying a callback function to each element, accumulating the results along the way. The `reduce` function provides flexibility for different reduction operations, such as summing the elements, finding the maximum or minimum value, concatenating strings, or performing more complex calculations.

It's worth noting that JavaScript also provides a built-in `Array.prototype.reduce` method that offers similar functionality.
