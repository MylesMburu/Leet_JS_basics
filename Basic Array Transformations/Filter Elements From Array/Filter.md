## Solution Explaination
The code defines a `filter` function that takes an array (`arr`) and a callback function (`fn`) as arguments. The purpose of this function is to filter the elements of the array based on the condition defined by the callback function.

1. Anonymous Function (Callback Function):
   - The `fn` parameter is an example of an anonymous function or callback function.
   - It is passed as an argument to the `filter` function and invoked within the function's implementation.
   - The callback function is expected to take an element from the array (`arr`) as its first parameter and the index of that element as the second parameter.
   - The callback function should return a truthy value if the element should be included in the filtered array or a falsy value if it should be excluded.

2. Array Iteration (for loop):
   - The `for` loop is used to iterate over each element of the array (`arr`).
   - The loop starts from index 0 and continues until `i` is less than the length of the array (`arr.length`).
   - On each iteration, the current element of the array is accessed using the index (`arr[i]`).

3. Filtering the Array:
   - The `fn` callback function is invoked with the current element and its index: `fn(arr[i], i)`.
   - The return value of the callback function (`filteredValue`) is then evaluated.
   - If the `filteredValue` is truthy (i.e., not false, 0, null, undefined, etc.), the current element is considered to pass the filter condition, and it is added to the `filteredArr` using `filteredArr.push(arr[i])`.

4. Returning the Filtered Array:
   - Once the iteration is complete, the `filteredArr` containing the elements that passed the filter condition is returned by the `filter` function.

The purpose of this code is to provide a simplified implementation of the `filter` higher-order function commonly found in JavaScript. It allows you to filter an array based on a given condition defined by the callback function (`fn`), returning a new array containing the filtered elements.
