# Solution Approach
The createCounter function accepts the initial value init and initializes a variable 'n' with that value.
The returned object contains three functions: increment, decrement, and reset.
- The increment function increases the n by 1 and returns the updated value.
- The decrement function decreases the n by 1 and returns the updated value.
- The reset function sets the n back to the initial value init and returns it.

Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of the createCounter function by creating a counter object and calling each function on it.
