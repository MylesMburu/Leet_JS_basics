## What's with the new code?
It's important to note that in the previous solution, the promises are awaited sequentially, meaning that promise2 will not start resolving until promise1 has completed. This can introduce unnecessary waiting if the promises are independent and could be resolved concurrently. Using <b>Promise.all</b> as shown in the initial code allows for parallel execution of the promises.

## Array Destructuring
Array destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that enables extracting values from arrays and objects in a clean and readable way.

In the code snippet const [res1, res2], the square brackets [res1, res2] represent array destructuring assignment. It is a way to extract values from an array or object and assign them to individual variables.

In the context of the code, Promise.all returns an array of resolved values in the same order as the input promises. By using array destructuring, we can assign those values to individual variables res1 and res2 in a concise manner.

For example, if Promise.all resolves to [3, 5], then res1 will be assigned the value 3, and res2 will be assigned the value 5. This allows us to access the resolved values conveniently and use them further in the code, such as adding them together as shown in the code snippet.

## Solution Approach
In this code, the addTwoPromises function remains the same as in the original example. It takes two promises, promise1 and promise2, and uses Promise.all to wait for both of them to resolve.

By passing an array of promises [promise1, promise2] to Promise.all, it returns a new promise that resolves with an array of the resolved values in the same order as the input promises. We use array destructuring to assign the resolved values to res1 and res2.

Finally, the function returns the sum of res1 and res2.
