## Solution Approach
The isEmpty function is defined with a parameter obj, which represents the object or array that we want to check for emptiness.

The function starts with an if statement to check if the obj is an array using the Array.isArray method:

- If obj is an array, it checks if the length of the array (obj.length) is equal to 0. If it is, it means the array is empty, so the function returns true.
- If the length is not 0, it means the array has elements, so the function returns false.

If the obj is not an array, the function proceeds to the next if statement, which checks if the obj is an object and not null using typeof and the null check:

- If obj is an object and not null, it uses Object.keys(obj) to retrieve an array of keys for the object. The Object.keys method returns an empty array if the object has no enumerable keys.
- The function then checks if the length of the keys array (Object.keys(obj).length) is equal to 0. If it is, it means the object has no key-value pairs and is empty, so the function returns true.
- If the length is not 0, it means the object has keys and is not empty, so the function returns false.

If the obj is neither an array nor an object, the function reaches the return false statement, indicating that it is not empty.
